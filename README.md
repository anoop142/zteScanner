# zteScanner

A go library to get connected 
devices from a ZTE ZXHN F670L WiFi Router.

This repo also contains a cli tool 
and a telegram bot based on this library.

## Why
I wanted to scan my WiFi network
for connented devices as fast as I could.
Scanning tools like arp-scanner, nmap etc..
everything took sometime and was hit or miss.

This method basically scraps ZTE dashboard and
extract the connected devices, along with their
IP Address, hostname and MAC Address.
